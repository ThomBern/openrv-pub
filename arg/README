This is source code to an argument parser with lots of nifty features.
It's written in C (Kernighan and Ritchie, not ANSI).

See the man page arg_parse.3 for documentation.
To test it run "make" and then play with the "tb" command.

This code is available via anonymous ftp from
hostess.graphics.cs.cmu.edu (128.2.206.188) in
/afs/cs/user/ph/www/src/arg/libarg.tar.Z
After you "get" the file, run
    zcat libarg.tar.Z | tar xvf -

If you find significant bugs in it, like it a lot, or enhance it significantly,
please send me email.
